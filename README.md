# invites

This repository allows members of the "maintainers" Github team to invite members to this organization.

## Usage

1. Create an ["Invite Member" issue](https://github.com/buildpacks-community/invites/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=invite.yml&title=Invite+Member).
2. Provide the username of the user you wish to invite. Eg. - samj1912
3. A [github action on this repository](https://github.com/buildpacks-community/invites/actions) should kick off with corresponding to the issue you just created.
4. If the invite is successful the original issue will be closed.
5. If the invite was unsuccessful or the action failed, simply re-open the issue. If the failure persists, please tag @maintainers on the issue.
